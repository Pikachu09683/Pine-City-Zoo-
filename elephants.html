                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land animals, characterized by their massive size, large ears, and long trunks
                    .</p>
                    <p>They are found in Africa and Asia, living in diverse habitats like savannas, grasslands, and forests.</p>
                    <p>Their trunk is incredibly versatile, used for communication, handling objects, and even breathing when submerged. Elephants face threats like poaching and habitat loss, and efforts are underway to protect them. </p>
